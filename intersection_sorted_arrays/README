Find Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays
Enter elements separated by spaces (e.g., '1 2 3 4')
Note: Arrays must be sorted in non-decreasing order

Enter first sorted array: 1 2 2 3 4 5 6
Enter second sorted array: 2 2 4 6 6 8 10

Results:
Array 1: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Array 2: [2, 2, 4, 6, 6, 8, 10]
Intersection: [2, 4, 6]
